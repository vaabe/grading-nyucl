Some scripts to streamline grading with NYU Classes. 

`./init` to add scripts to $PATH. 

`grade -s` to create a `comments.md` file template in each student directory, and an "inprogress" indicator to prevent accidental overwrites. 

`grade -g` to loop through comments files, extract the grade, record in data library. 

`grade -f` to reconvert files back to format required by Classes.
